Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's caused by an extremely stressful or terrifying event â€” either being part of it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety and uncontrollable thoughts about the event.
Most people who go through traumatic events may have a hard time adjusting and coping for a short time. But with time and by taking good care of themselves, they usually get better. If the symptoms get worse, last for months or years, and affect their ability to function daily, they may have PTSD.

Symptoms
Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within the first three months after a traumatic event. But sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms last more than one month and cause major problems in social or work situations and how well you get along with others. They also can affect your ability to do your usual daily tasks.
Generally, PTSD symptoms are grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to person.

Intrusive memories:
Unwanted, distressing memories of a traumatic event that come back over and over again.
Reliving a traumatic event as if it were happening again, also known as flashbacks.
Upsetting dreams or nightmares about a traumatic event.
Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to something that reminds you of a traumatic event.

Avoidance:
Trying not to think or talk about a traumatic event.
Staying away from places, activities or people that remind you of a traumatic event.

Negative changes in thinking and mood:
Negative thoughts about yourself, other people or the world.
Ongoing negative emotions of fear, blame, guilt, anger or shame.
Memory problems, including not remembering important aspects of a traumatic event.
Feeling detached from family and friends.
Not being interested in activities you once enjoyed.
Having a hard time feeling positive emotions.
Feeling emotionally numb.

Changes in physical and emotional reactions:
Being easily startled or frightened.
Always being on guard for danger.

When to see a doctor:
Talk to your healthcare professional or a mental health professional if you have disturbing thoughts and feelings about a traumatic event for more than a month, especially if they're severe. Also, see a health professional if you're having trouble getting your life back under control. Getting treatment as soon as possible can help prevent PTSD symptoms from getting worse.
